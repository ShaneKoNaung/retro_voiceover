Crew: Captain Cecil, we are about to arrive! Cecil: Good.
Crew: Why are we robbing crystals from innocent people? Crew: That's our duty. Crew: Do we really have to keep doing this?
Crew: Give us the Crystal of Water! Elder: What have we done? Cecil: The crystal or your life! Black Wizard: Never! Cecil: Then, take the crystal by force!
Black Wizard: WAAAH!
White Wizard: No! Don't! Crew: Dare to defy us?
White Wizard: ARRRGH!
Elder: My! All right... Take the crystal! Crew: You should have said it earlier!
Elder: Why is the King of Baron doing this? Why do you pursue the crystals so eagerly? Cecil: ......
Crew: We take pride in being members of the Red Wings! Looting is out of the question!
Cecil: Stop it!
Crew: Captain! Crew: We can't stand doing this anymore! Cecil: Listen! Possessing the crystal is an essential factor for our prosperity. Moreover, His Majesty judged that Mysidians know too much about the secret of the crystal. We are the Red Wings, the air force of the Kingdom Baron! The Royal Command is absolute. Crew: Captain!
Crew: Monsters!!
Cecil: Take up fighting positions!
Crew: Ouch! Cecil: You Okay? Crew: More coming! Cecil: Watch out!
Cecil: Everyone okay?
Crew: Yes, sir! Crew: But there are too many monsters these days... Crew: Too many, agreed. Cecil: What's happening?
Crew: We are over Baron! Cecil: Make a landing.
Baigan: Oh, Cecil! Is it the Crystal of Water? Cecil: But Mysidians were so helpless. Baigan: What are you trying to say? This way, Cecil.
Baigan: Please wait here.
Baigan: Your Majesty! I'm afraid Cecil has developed quite a rebellious air. King: Truly!? Well done, Baigan! We must do something. Call him in! Baigan: Yes, Your Majesty.
Baigan: Cecil!  His Majesty summons you. Please come in.
King: We thank you for successfully completing the mission. Now, where is it? Cecil: Here, My Liege.
Hand over the crystal.
Baigan: Real crystal... King: Good!  Cecil...... You may leave now.
Cecil: Your Majesty!
King: W... What? Baigan: W... What is it?
Cecil: We do not understand the meaning of taking crystals away from honest people. King: Disobeying me? Cecil: No, I don't. King: We do know of your discontent, Cecil. If you cannot trust me, I can no longer place the Red Wings in your command. You are dismissed from your post!
Cecil: Your Majesty!
King: Go and hunt the Summoned Monsters of the Misty Valley! And... Take this Package to the Village Mist. You may depart tomorrow morning!
Kain: Your Majesty!
Kain: Cecil didn't...
King: If you're concerned about Cecil that much, go with him, Kain! Cecil: Your Majesty! King: Now! Leave with the Package!
Received the Package.
Cecil: Your Majesty!
(see below)
Cecil: Sorry, Kain. Kain: Don't worry. He'll put you back in command of the Red Wings after this mission. Cecil: But... Kain: Never mind! Go back to your room and take a rest. Walk in all directions using the Control Pad and talk to every person you meet using the A-Button. You must be careful not to miss what they say. An unexpected person may give you information.
Kain: What's wrong? Cecil: Sorry Kain... Kain: Oh, stop that! Cecil: I mastered the Dark Sword as commanded by His Majesty. But, it was to defend and not to rob. Kain: Do not blame yourself. His Majesty must have his own reason.
Rosa: Cecil!
Rosa: You are not hurt? I was so anxious. Cecil: We are not hurt. How could we be? The wizards didn't even raise their hands.
Rosa: Cecil!
Rosa: Can I see you later? Cecil: Yeah. Later.
You don't understand! The crystal is not just jewelry!
Please return the crystal to Mysidia!
Cid: Hey! Cecil!
Cid: How's my airship doing? ...What's wrong? Cecil: I was... Cid: What?! Who's gonna command the Red Wings then? I'm not sure what the King is thinking. He ordered me to make an airship, but I don't want it to be used as a weapon! Well, I gotta go home. I have been working all night, and my daughter is worried about me.
I've changed the sheets. Leaving early tomorrow morning, sir? Good night.
Cecil: What happened to His Majesty? The crystal of Mysidia... Did we really have to snatch it from the peace loving people? Never again! Even if ordered!
Rosa: Cecil!
Rosa:  What's wrong? You're not quite yourself lately. Cecil: Nothing.
Rosa: Then... Please don't look away.
Cecil: In Mysidia... We had to rob from the innocent people!
Rosa: Oh, dear...
Cecil: I am just a Dark Knight with no courage to disobey His Majesty.
Rosa: The real Cecil I know would never whimper like this!
Rosa: You are going to Mist tomorrow, right? If anything should happen to you...
Cecil: Don't worry. Kain is coming, too.
Cecil: It's late. Go back to your room.
Rosa: Take care!
Cecil: Thanks, Rosa. Still, I am just a Dark Knight.
Kain: Let's go, Cecil. Outside the Castle is the city of Baron. Let's gather information and equipment in the city.
Thus, the Dark Knight Cecil was expelled from his command as a Captain of the Red Wings. And he and Dragoon Kain left Baron for the Village Mist in a valley enclosed in deep fog. Airships had been a dream of many people... After the realization of the dream, came greed and ambition. Through its fleet of airships, Baron became the most powerful nation. But why is Baron seeking the crystals? Why do the monsters keep increasing...? The crystal was shedding its light silently......
